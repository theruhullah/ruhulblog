When you gave me the butterfly box, I, for a while wondered why you enjoyed such a trashy thing. But I guess even as I pondered, I knew. We all enjoy a little 
trash. 

And you used to entertain the thought of your life being a little trash. So you enjoyed that little piece for trash art,
as a projection of the trash you thought of your life, the things you've done, and the person you became. It's trash, it is. But it's still ours.
And that's why we enjoy it. It's what we have. If we have nothing else, we'll always have our trash. 

If we can't be happy, then we shall enjoy our misery.

I treasure that you shared your trash with me, unashamedly.

Faithfully.

Perhaps naively...
