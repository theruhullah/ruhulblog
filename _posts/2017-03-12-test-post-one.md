I've been meaning to write a post about eCommerce best practices. 

Unfortunately, I don't know any. 

But I'll be <i>darned</i> if I let it this post end without hitting my 250 word quota. Only two hundred and eighteen to go.

Rather than filling the post with amusing cat gifs, I decided some research would be necessary. I pulled up my favourite researching tool, ie. Google, and got down to it.

Stunned by the results I found (which we'll get to further on, they're great, you'll LOVE number 6) I've decided it would be better to retrace our steps a  little to determine what best practices are in the first place:

#### Once upon a time...

a bunch of intoxicated Swiss chaps got together and decided to play a cruel joke on the world. Thus, ISO compliance was born. 

As a result, businesses and organizations of any kind could now own thick, arcane rule-books to help prevent office doors from shutting automatically. Tech wasn't great back then...

The world was introduced to new, modern set of best practices, covering standards for things like measuring temperature and weight, or the pleasant reading of standards for freight containers, and even the hidden 8th dimension of hell: human resource vocabulary. 

You see, these folks were actually eminent professionals from various industries all over the world. Through their example we know that best practices are created not the result of one individuals work, in an isolated environment. They <i>certainly</i> aren't the result of repeated baseless rhetoric, something 
we see a lot of. 

Based on iterative experimentation and feedback, a set of standards that outline how best to tackle a task and quantify its components are called best practices. Best practices exist for a vast variety of industries, eCommerce being no exception.

Except - - I often find myself questioning some practices of our online conduct, that have come to be known as "best", many of which I find dubious. Just as often, I suspect many of these practices are merely a bunch of regular, if not downright atrocious practices. These suspicions are a result of consideration about my own behaviour on the Net, as both a marketer and a "market".

A fine example of such a "best" practice is the use of popups. Years ago, popup advertisements quickly became the bane of digital surfers everywhere, that people began using blockers to counter the invasion. Although still around, the practice in its original form has <i>mostly</i> faded. People of the Net protested the practice by installing the above mentioned filters, such as popup blockers, to free themselves of a practice found to be intrusive and irritating. Their voices were heard loud and clea-

-no, unfortunately that voice was drowned out by a more thunderous voice of reworked use cases. So, popups found new refuge and continue its existence, they've just mutated into a different form. Now popups reside inside your browser itself, as part of the design, or as lightboxes. They show up when you've 
stayed on a page for say, 5-30 seconds. Or most conveniently, if you decide to "bounce" from the site. 

Digital marketing practitioners claim these popups as being darn effective at collecting emails. Lead generators they're called. Few successes are cited by very many, and I find it hard to believe they constitute best practice. Based upon my experience with popups, which I don't think is unique, it rather seems that in general, popups simply isn't a good practice to begin with. 

BUT WAIT!

This isn't a popup bashing post. It's about what are best practices, with regard to online retailing. So how do we determine ecommerce best practices?

Actually, even our eCommerce platform has a popup generator for merchants who wish to have it. It was launched last year with the v8 update. I've encountered a number of our merchants who have adopted the tech on their sites, but I have no information about its effectiveness. Without that information I cannot offer conclusive words about whether they should or shouldn't be used, for what purpose they work best, or in which industries, ie. best practices.

Since the proliferation of the internet, much more knowledge has been shared than ever before, allowing us to communicate our experiences, and the stories of our successes (and failures), in greater scale than that typical of ancient marketplaces and bazaars. On the flip-side, much more ignorance has also been
shared, cleverly masquerading as actual knowledge. 

And this is where the ISO compliance lies: a set of processes that scholarly business people got together to work on. Drawing from their collective experiences to ultimately decide how business should be conducted, the emphasis on maximizing efficiency and retaining quality. 

Best practices are built upon solid foundations, of testing theories and ideas. Without these foundations, the processes crumble under scrutiny of what is indeed, best to be practiced.

How about we now look at some currently popular best practices promoted on the Net. 

Here (https://blog.optimizely.com/2015/10/29/ecommerce-best-practices) is a blog post in the format of a 9-point listicle. 9 because ten is too round a number, wouldn't stand out as well, and won't take up as much time to read compared to 10 whole points (listicle best practices at work).

I won't argue every point made in the post. I have no evidence to run with, and after all, they are the experts of what <i>should</i> work best for conversions, even if citation to any research is sparse on this particular post. The message I get from this list is that in eCommerce, the best practice isto test for best practices. It's really quite meta. An example:

The second point states "Experiment with the best email capture methods"

Are eCommerce owners supposed to implement this astonishingly obvious concept? Does common sense really require a spot on any best practice list? 

Anecdote: I once ran a display campaign for a client and noticed some odd results. It appeared that the ads that appeared at lower ranked positions not only cost the campaign less, but it also got better click-through rates. Ever suspicious, I dug deeper and found the same was true in several other campaign
belonging to that client. This was an eye opener for me, as conventional wisdom at the time was that No. 1 was the goal, always. It was a given that the cost of outbidding competitors would be overcome by the significantly better results of display ads being at the top position. So was this oddity best practice for
us after that? Certainly not. Having had access to several other accounts, I found no other instances of this happening to any significant degree. Perhaps the company could have considered it best practice for <i>their</i> future campaigns.  Perhaps it might be best practice for their entire industry. I don't
know, and I don't know who does.

To be clear, I suspect that we haven't developed many actual best practices for online retail, and for the most part we are stumbling around in the dark trying to discover a light switch. 

What we need is empirical evidence of different eCommerce practices. It means we should remain skeptical about proclaimed best practices, and consult our peers --each other-- share our information, and determine if a process can be replicated with similar, widespread success. We can start by segmenting 
different optional eCommerce features, like flash sales, customizations, personalizations, usability tools, tracking, retargeting ads (highly suspect), push notifications, lead capture. Just those few.

Otherwise we'll be working based on assumptions of what is good to be practiced, which of course everyone has an opinion of. If we are to believe every opinion available, the above ambiguity is what we'll get.

In the end, you'll be left with a whole library of best practices - -some hilariously contradictory ones - - encompassing the entire breath of practices ever attempted.

That's when several drunk Europeans will decide its time for another practical joke.
