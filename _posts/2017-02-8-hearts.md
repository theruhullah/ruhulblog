It's debilitating, but I don't think there's a way to fully love someone without having your heart broken by them.

Some things are completely unexpected of the ones we love. You think they will treat our affection with care, and vice versa.

No one is incapable of screwing up sometimes. And if you can come back from a fuck up SOBAD they've taken your love, hurled it to the ground, shattering it into billions of sharp pieces, just to watch you fall upon it, writhe in agony rolling over every single shard, hoping to absorb it into fullness once again.  

If you can come back from that, and still expect to be able to do it again the next time, I think you're ready.
