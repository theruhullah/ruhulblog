<p>When you gave me the butterfly box, I, for a while wondered, why you enjoyed such a trashy thing. But I guess even as I pondered, I knew. We all enjoy a little 
trash.</p>

<p>And you used to entertain the thought of your life being a little trash. So you enjoyed that little piece of trash art, as a projection of the trash you thought of your life, the things you’ve done, and the person you became. It’s trash, it is. But it’s still ours.</p>

<p>And that’s why we enjoy it. It’s what we have. If we have nothing else, we’ll always have our trash.</p>

<p>If we can’t be happy, then we shall enjoy our misery.</p>

<p>I treasure that you shared your trash with me, unashamedly.</p>

<p>Faithfully.</p>

<p>Perhaps naively…</p>
