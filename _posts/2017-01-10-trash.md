You gave me the butterfly box, and I for a while wondered, why you enjoyed such a trashy thing. But even as I pondered, I knew: we all enjoy a little trash. 

And you used to entertain the thought of your life being a little bit trash. So you enjoyed that little piece of trash art, as a manifestation of the trash you thought of your life, the things you've done, and the person you became. It's trash, it is... 

But it's still ours. And that's why we enjoy it. It's what we have. 

If we have nothing else, we'll always have our trash. 

If we can't find joy, we enjoy our misery instead.

Unashamedly.

Faithfully.

Perhaps naively...
