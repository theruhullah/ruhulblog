These parallel worlds refuse us to cross paths,  
Separated even by a mere hairs breath,  
So small yet so wide,  
Not even our most modest of wishes reach across so great a divide.    

Always right before my eyes in the distance,  
Yet never able reach for that reassuring touch,  
Unable to see what your eyes do reflect,  
And in the black of my eyes is an empty shell.

If contact were not so unforgivable,   
Among tiny lovers in these parallel worlds,  
These dreams we always dream,  
Would they not seem quite so aligned?  

Ah...!
