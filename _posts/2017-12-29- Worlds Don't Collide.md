These parallel worlds refuse us to cross paths,  
Even though separated by a mere hairs breath,  
So small yet so wide,  
Not even our most modest of wishes reach across a divide so great.    

Always right before my eyes in the distance,  
Yet never can we reach out for that reassuring touch,  
Unable to see what your eyes do reflect,  
And in the black of my eyes is an empty shell.

If contact were not so unforgivable,   
Among tiny lovers in these parallel worlds,  
These dreams we always dream,  
Would they not seem quite so aligned?  

Ah...!
