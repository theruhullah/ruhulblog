You give me the butterfly box, and I for a while wonder, why you enjoyed such a trashy thing. But even as I ponder, I know: we all enjoy a little trash. 

And you'd entertain the thought of your life being a little bit trash. So you enjoyed that little piece of trash art, as a manifestation of the trash you thought of your life, the things you've done, and the person you became. It's trash, it is... 

But it's still ours, and that's how we appreciate it. It's what we have, at the very least. 

If we have nothing else, we'll always have our roots. 

If we can't find joy, we enjoy our misery instead.

Unashamedly.

Faithfully.

Perhaps naively...

WHAT THE HEYY??
