  <h1 id="tracking-protection">TRACKING PROTECTION</h1>

<p>If a strangers rings you up, and asks for your personal information over the phone, would you volunteer any? Even if it something as benign as your favourite colour, or which ice-cream flavour you prefer, wouldn’t you find it creepy?</p>

<p>If you do, then you might be interested to increase your privacy online.</p>

<p>On the internet, most commercial websites have dozens of third party scripts running, that collect your browsing data, and use this mainly to target advertisements at you. In most continents, this is common practice and there are no laws against it.</p>

<p>In fact countries like the US are constantly trying to make tracking you <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/congress-dont-let-internet-providers-sell-our-data-highest-bidder">law approved</a>. And <a href="http://www.inc.com/adam-levin/how-donald-trump-is-about-to-gut-privacy-protection-for-every-internet-user.html">here</a>…</p>

<p><img src="/img/ohnein.gif" alt="He did" title="Oh Nein!" /></p>

<p>Most of these third parties are unknown, what they do with this data is unknown, and where the data goes, who else gets to use it is all unknown.</p>

<p>Blocking online advertisements is actually a luxury side effect of getting tracking protection. Sometimes, these cookies also contain malware, that can either cause harm to your operating system, or steal financial information from you.</p>

<p>This is bad for website publishers, it’s bad for advertisers, and it’s bad for internet users.</p>

<h2 id="when-you-protect-yourself-from-third-party-tracking-youre-helping-to">When you protect yourself from third-party tracking, you’re helping to:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Protect yourself from malware that spreads through ad networks.</li>
  <li>Protect your favorite web sites from data leakage and advertising fraud.</li>
  <li>Protect brands from accidentally supporting illegal sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a nutshell, you will see less of the annoying ads that follow you around the internet.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-badger"><a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">PRIVACY BADGER</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger"><u>Privacy Badger</u></a>, a project of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/"><u>Electronic Frontier Foundation</u></a>, is a tracking protection extension for Firefox and Google Chrome. Privacy Badger only blocks trackers that it detects following you across multiple sites. <strong>This extension is recommended for you.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger"><u>GET PRIVACY BADGER HERE</u></a></strong></p>

<p>Once you install the extension, you will need to ensure its three protection settings are enabled. Do this by clicking on the badger icon (usually top right of your browser), and clicking the gear icon to go to the settings page.</p>

<p><img src="/img/badger_settings.png" alt="Privacy Badger Settings" title="Privacy Badger Settings" /></p>

<p>Go to General Settings tab, and make sure all three boxes are checked. That’s it.</p>

<p>To see it in action, go to a site like <a href="www.forbes.com">www.forbes.com</a> and click on the badger icon again.</p>

<p>You will see something similar:</p>

<p><img src="/img/badgerdetection.png" alt="Tracking Protection Works" title="Tracking Protection: ON" /></p>

<p>The sliders indicate the level of protection you receive. Some cookies are harmless, and are indeed meant to improve your browsing experience, simply by saving in your browser cache images and html templates of sites you have visited. This enables those sites to load faster on subsequent visits.</p>

<p>You won’t have to tamper with the sliders, since badger is updates in real-time and has a very good judgement of what is harmful, and which cookies are meant to track your activities across different websites.</p>

<p>In this example we see that badger has detected 14 <em>potential</em> trackers on this page, and has automatically blocked several of them.</p>

<p>In reality, Forbes website has once of the <em>worst</em> load times of publishers, because it has tracking cookies from over 300 (last I checked) third party scripts.</p>

<p>I only receive a fraction of that because I also run:</p>

<h2 id="adblock-plus"><a href="https://adblockplus.org/">ADBLOCK PLUS</a></h2>

<p>Adblock Plus is not a good company. Companies like these hold advertisers and publishers ransom by providing us- internet users- the ability to block ads. Publishers and adtech companies like Google/Tabloo/Adobe are required to pay them to have their scripts whitelisted on their application, and then we users get to see their ads.</p>

<p>However, they provide the best tool for us to never have to see ads on Youtube, or those particularly irritating ones that follow us around. Thankfully they are still quite a consumer friendly and do offer robust blocking options, compared to alternative software, and thus far have never held users ransom.</p>

<p><a href="https://adblockplus.org/"><strong><u>GET ADBLOCK PLUS HERE</u></strong></a></p>

<p>Get the free version, it is sufficient. Don’t upgrade to PRO.</p>

<p>As with badger, you should click on the ABP icon on your browser, and go to the settings menu:</p>

<p><img src="/img/adblockoptions.png" alt="ABP Options" title="ABP Options" /></p>

<p>I recommend leaving your settings like this. The other tabs are more advanced and are safe to play with if you wish to explore. They lead to a more customized internet experience for you, but takes a little know-how.</p>

<p>I leave the “Allow some non-intrusive advertising” option checked, for professional reasons. Someday when pigs fly I’ll have an example of good online advertising, and that will be a turning point. But as of today, there is no real way to determine a good advertisement from a bad one.</p>

<p>We have no way of knowing which are tracking us and which are harmlessly trying to get some marketing/sales message in front of us.</p>

<p>You however, might want to play with it and test how it affects your experience with websites. I’ve visited websites drowning in adtech while completely cloacked, and then without any protection/blocking. The results meant I either saw a completely stripped down version of html, with no formatting, or the brain-jamming version with ads, and popups, and notifications.</p>

<p>You can go to a local news portal like theStar or FreeMalaysiaToday and test out the different settings to see what you are comfortable blocking.</p>

<p>Note: <u>test with AdBlock Plus, not with badger.</u></p>

<p>Some publisher like Forbes are fighting the Adblock War, and once an adblocker is detected when you visit these sites, they will “ask” that you disable the app in order to access their content:</p>

<p><img src="/img/forbesjunk.png" alt="Gated Content on Forbes" title="Content Gateway" /></p>

<p>Personally, when I encounter sites like these I close it and never go back. You can determine for yourself if the content is worth seeing their ads for.</p>

<p>There is a whole discussion to be had here, but for another time. <u>The short version</u> is that these publishers are funded by advertisements, and by using an adblocker, you are denying them the opportunity to show advertisements to you. On the other hand, visitors who use adblockers aren’t going to click on ads, and therefore aren’t interested in seeing them, much less being tracked by them. And so much more…</p>

<h2 id="browser-choice">Browser Choice</h2>

<p>This is completely up to you, but the safest, least privacy infringing browser in the market is currently Firefox. It has tracking protection built in. That plus the above two tools will ensure an even greater degree of privacy.</p>

<p>Safari has in recent years also begin to adopt privacy policies, so if you use Apple products, Safari is a good choice. Apple products also do not support flash based plugins by default, so that is a huge plus itself, since many forms of malware are embedded onto flash scripts (ie Youtube).</p>

<h2 id="search-engines">Search Engines</h2>

<p>Chrome is the most convenient browser. It links all your accounts, across all your devices.</p>

<p>Which leaves little room for protecting your data, or preventing your data from being linked to your personal profiles.</p>

<p>Incognito modes are decent short term option. Better is a little known wonder called <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>. Check it out, it might become your go-to search engine.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you’ve come this far, and still have a burning desire to protect yourself even further, feel free to email me with your concerns.</p>

<p>For general internet use, the steps I’ve outlined are sufficient to enjoy using the internet without having to worry about being spied on.</p>

<p>For your information, I DO track visitor behavior on this website (via Google Analytics only- you can check with your newly installed protections), because this is a private domain, and I want to know what people do on it, and how.</p>

<p>I fund this domain myself, and don’t run advertising on it. The cookie I run expires after you leave, and therefore does not track you past any of the pages on this domain. It has no way of determining who you are, and what else you do on the internet. How it works, and what it does will certainly change over time, but the basic principle of not using tracking scripts from unknown/unverified sources won’t.</p>

<p>I think that’s fair.</p>

<p>If you don’t, let me know why.</p>
