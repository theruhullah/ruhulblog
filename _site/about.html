<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>**            **My experience with digital marketing is extensive; Iwas hooked as soon as I first learnt how to use the internet. In college Istarted my career as an affiliate marketer, learning about content marketing,email marketing, and paid advertising, while using my basic web developmentskills to create websites. Later I supplemented this knowledge with marketing principlesI learnt during lectures and by reading.</p>

<p>As a marketer Iam best experienced at direct marketing, since marketing online is mostly directresponse marketing. While direct marketing can be very effective for useracquisition, it is unfortunately not effective and brand building, which is oneof personal goals as a marketer.</p>

<p>I enjoynon-profit work as I find it rewarding, but I also like the challenges thatcome with working for large business entities on their digital campaigns.</p>

<p>My favouritepart of digital marketing used to be the paid advertising; you could say I wasan evangelist even. It offers a vast amount of data to be gleaned and analysed.However, it also causes a lot of problems for internet users, and the rise of adblockers and tracking protection is testament to that fact. Hence, it is ourjob as marketers to make better ads, and not be so hung up of the data and thetracking, allowing more creativity back into the industry.</p>

<p>By the time I’min my mid-thirties I would like have managed digital marketing teams, somethingI have not had the opportunity to do. I value experience and want a whole lotmore of it. Ideally I will also be part of the publishing industry as aproducer (possibly fiction &amp; scriptwriting) as I am a writer at heart, andhopefully even a business owner.</p>

<p>There is muchroom for growth; I want to make it happen.</p>
